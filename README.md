### Rust Piscine
The Rust Piscine (or Rust Short) was a one-week bootcamp/challenge in October 2024, introducing us to the basics of Rust language at 42 Vienna coding school.
Each day we received 8 exercises, and had to complete at least 5 of them to validate the day. We needed to validate a minimum of 5 out of all 7 days to pass the whole Piscine.

Topics covered:
- **Day 0:** Primitives, mutability, flow of control (loops, match statement). Setting up a Cargo project. Fighting the compiler.
- **Day 1:** Setting up a cargo workspace. Built-in unit testing with Cargo. Lifetime annotations. Fighting Clippy and the compiler.
- **Day 2:** Type aliasing, structures, enums, member functions with `impl` keyword. Fighting Clippy and the compiler again.
- **Day 3:** Generics (basically templates), traits, operator overloading. Turbofish. More fighting with Clippy and the compiler.
- **Day 4:** File I/O, panicking, child processes, taking arguments. Slowly getting used to fighting Clippy and the compiler.
- **Day 5:** Multithreading, mutexes, Boxes and Cells, atomic types, Arc pointer. Getting really tired of fighting Clippy & compiler.
- **Day 6:** Handling unsafe functions and blocks of code. Trying to write Rust like C and crying. Finally being done with Clippy and the compiler.
